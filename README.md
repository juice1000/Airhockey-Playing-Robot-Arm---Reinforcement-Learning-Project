# Airhockey-Playing-Robot-Arm---Reinforcement-Learning-Project
Enable a simulated robot arm to become a competitive opponent against a real player using different Reinforcement Learning algorithms. Used algorithms: Q-Learning, SARSA, DQN Simulate one player as the agent, the other arm can be controlled by user.
